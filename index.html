  <p>Hi folks!</p>
  <p>To those of you who have been using this app, I hope it has proven useful. I have created a version 2 of this app with some aesthetic, performance and security improvements. This one has now been shut down. You can access the new one here: <a href="https://player.keshpianomusic.com/">player.keshpianomusic.com</a></p>
  <p>As part of the security improvements, everyone who has purchased the control panel in the past has been assigned a license key on Gumroad (the website where you bought it). If you check your gumroad emails, you'll be able to view the product page where you can view the license key assigned to you. If you have any issues at all finding this, send me an email and I will find it for you. kesh@keshpianomusic.com. You'll need this license key to log in to the version 2 of the app.</p>
  <p>Best regards, Kesh</p>
